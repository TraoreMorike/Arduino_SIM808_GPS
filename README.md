**README**

This Arduino sketch uses a SoftwareSerial library to communicate with a SIM808 module, which provides GPS functionality. The code allows you to send AT commands to the SIM808 and read responses from it.

**Features:**

* Sends AT commands to the SIM808 and waits for responses
* Supports basic GPS operations, such as:
	+ Powering on/off the SIM808 GPS module
	+ Configuring NMEA sentences (time, date, position, course, and speed data)
	+ Reading GPS coordinates from the SIM808

**Usage:**

1. Upload this code to your Arduino board.
2. Connect the SIM808 module to digital pins 7, 8, and 9 on your Arduino board according to the pinout definitions in this code.
3. Power on the SIM808 module using the PWRKEY_PIN (pin 9).
4. Use serial commands to interact with the SIM808, such as sending "GET_GPS" to request GPS coordinates.

**Commands:**

* `AT+CGNSPWR=1`: Powers on the SIM808 GPS module
* `AT+CGNSSEQ=RMC`: Configures NMEA sentences (time, date, position, course, and speed data)
* `AT+CGNSINF`: Returns GPS coordinates
* `GET_GPS`: Requests GPS coordinates from the SIM808

**Debugging:**

* Set `DEBUG` to 1 to enable debug output on the serial console.

**Notes:**

* This code assumes that you have already installed the SoftwareSerial library and configured your Arduino board's serial port.
* Make sure to adjust the pinout definitions in this code to match your specific SIM808 module configuration.
